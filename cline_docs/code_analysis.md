# Code Analysis

## Files Exceeding 300 Lines
Currently, no files exceed the 300-line limit.

## Component Analysis

### WikiStream.tsx (Current: ~80 lines)
Component is well-structured and within size limits. Key sections:
- State management
- WebSocket connection handling
- UI rendering
- Error handling

### Potential Refactoring Opportunities

1. Extract WebSocket Logic
```typescript
// Consider creating a custom hook:
function useWikiStream() {
  // WebSocket connection logic
  // State management
  // Event handlers
}
```

2. UI Components
```typescript
// Could extract into separate components:
- ConnectionStatus
- ErrorDisplay
- ChangesList
- ChangeItem
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Complexity Analysis
- Components maintain single responsibility
- Logic separation is clear
- Error handling is comprehensive
- State management is straightforward

### Performance Considerations
- Change list limited to 50 items
- WebSocket connection properly managed
- Event listeners cleaned up on unmount

## Future Recommendations
1. Monitor component growth during music integration
2. Consider extracting shared logic into custom hooks
3. Keep UI components focused and minimal
4. Maintain current pattern of clear separation of concerns
